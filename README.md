## Create a function declaration called addToDo that takes a STRING as a param and does the following:
- add a task to the taskArr
    - addToDo("grocery");
    - addToDo("feeding cat");
    - addToDo("coding");
- prints out the taskArr
    - E.g [ 'grocery', 'feeding cat', 'coding' ]

## Create a function declaration called removeToDo that accepts a STRING and does the following:
- remove a specific task from the taskArr
- prints out the taskArr

## Delete all the above console logs.
## Create a function declaration called "printTasks" that takes 0 parameters and prints out:
- number of tasks in the array 
- full description of tasks to complete 

Example:
You still have 2 tasks to complete
Task 1 = "some task"
Task 2 = "some other task"

The function has to be dynamic (has to work regardless of how many tasks are present in the array)

### Once you are done, create a new js file called "funcExp" and turn all your function declaration into function expression
### Then create a "arrowFunc" js file and turn all of the functions in arrow function.
